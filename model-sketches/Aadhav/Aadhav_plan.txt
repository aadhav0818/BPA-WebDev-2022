Implement a 5 minute cooldown before requests.

HOME PAGE: Build a navigation bar that has the logo on the left with a search bar, as implemented
in Aditya_CarQuiz. In the front of the page, have the name of the company in big text
with a car background that is changing on it. Have the vision underneath that. Explain what the website
is about in a box below that and then prompt a list of the tools and services offered by our site.
On the bottom of the page, have a more section where users can quick access everything.

LOAN ESTIMATOR: Have user enter in car in the input box and their specific make. Then have a field for the user to 
enter their credit score information and their personal information that can affect a loan. Once all user information
is given to the calculator, have a bar graph stem from a wall in a color that reflects the percentage of the car amount
being covered by the loan. Have a second bar in varying shades of red for the interest rate. Have a selection
section to select the amount of years you want the loan to be for, and have the graph change accordingly.
